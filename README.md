# Venmo-Social-Network-Analysis
Venmo is a peer-to-peer (P2P) mobile payment app owned by PayPal. The Venmo app allows its users to exchange money with just a click of a button. In the fourth quarter of 2019, Venmo’s net payment volume amounted to 29 billion U.S. dollars, representing a 56 percent year-on-year growth, and its user-base had more than 40 million active accounts1. What made Venmo so popular in the US is its social flavor; users are required to accompany their transactions with a message describing what the transaction was about. This social twist has allowed Venmo to transform financial transactions into sharing experiences.  
The goal of this analysis was to understand user's social network profile, then based on the social graph of each user, predict user's spending profile.  
All the code is done using Pyspark.
